DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and SPF (Sender Policy Framework) work together to enhance email authentication and security. Here's how the process unfolds in detail:

Step 1: Sender Configures SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
SPF:

The domain owner publishes an SPF record in DNS.
The SPF record specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain.
DKIM:

The domain owner generates a public-private key pair.
The public key is published in DNS as a TXT record.
The private key is stored securely and used by the mail server to sign outgoing emails with a digital signature.
DMARC:

The domain owner creates a DMARC policy and publishes it in DNS.
The DMARC policy specifies:
How to handle emails failing SPF/DKIM checks (none, quarantine, reject).
Where to send reports of authentication results (e.g., failure reports).
Step 2: Sender Sends an Email
The sender’s mail server:
Checks its SPF record to confirm it is authorized to send.
Adds a DKIM signature to the email using the domain’s private key.
Step 3: Recipient’s Mail Server Processes the Email
SPF Validation:

The recipient’s server queries the DNS for the sender’s SPF record.
It checks if the sending server's IP matches the SPF record.
Result: pass or fail.
DKIM Validation:

The recipient’s server checks for a DKIM-Signature in the email header.
It retrieves the public key from the sender’s DNS and uses it to verify the signature.
Result: pass or fail.
DMARC Enforcement:

The recipient’s server checks the DMARC policy in the sender’s DNS.
DMARC verifies:
Whether the email passes SPF and/or DKIM.
Whether the “From” address aligns with the domain used in SPF/DKIM.
Based on the DMARC policy:
Emails failing DMARC are rejected, quarantined, or allowed through.
Step 4: Reporting and Feedback
The recipient sends feedback (as specified in the DMARC record) back to the domain owner about:
Authentication results.
Any failures or suspicious activities.
Reports help the domain owner refine their SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration and monitor misuse.
Example Workflow
Scenario: Email sent from example.com
Sender: Mail server of example.com sends an email.
SPF:
Recipient queries DNS for example.com's SPF record.
The sending server’s IP matches, so SPF passes.
DKIM:
The email has a DKIM signature.
Recipient retrieves example.com's public key from DNS.
The signature verifies successfully, so DKIM passes.
DMARC:
Recipient checks DMARC policy for example.com.
DMARC requires SPF/DKIM to pass and "From" to align with the domain.
Both pass, so the email is delivered.
Benefits of Using All Three
SPF:
Prevents spoofing by verifying authorized mail servers.
DKIM:
Ensures message integrity and authenticity.
DMARC:
Aligns SPF/DKIM results with the "From" domain.
Enforces actions on failed messages.
Provides reporting for enhanced monitoring.
