# Code-optimization
 Code optimization is a technique by which we can optimize our code by deleting all "dead codes" and by eleminating "common expressions" from the inputs.
# Dead code
Dead code is that codes or expressions which does not affect output of the expressions(arithmatic).
e.g a=9
b=c+d
c=7 and d=3 ...here "a=9" is dead code...
# Common expression
The expressions which either "R value"(right value) or both "L values (left values) and R values " are same,are called common expressions.

e.g a=b+c
f=b+c
are common expressions..

# Code based...
Here we can use the csv file(input.csv) as input, which contains the two header "left" and "right" for "L value" and "R value " respectively.

Other file is "output1.csv", which is used to store the intermediate results..

"Code optimization.jpg" file is final output...
